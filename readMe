1. Calculator - one of possible implementations for raised on interview question

2.SmartHomeVerySimlify/SmartHomeSolution - part of model + part of command for one of own project + few examples of command usage

Initial idea (some points):
 - sorry, it's almost no comments, as it's my own project and hadn't time on it
 - projects works with hardware located in network (in my case - in local wifi network, but also has internet access, so available out of home network);
 - hardware part contains from different devices;
 - all of them:
     Device 1 ----\
     Device 2 -----> [Software bridge with web api] [has url]
     Device 3 ----/

  with this [bridge] we can get list of devices, send commands to them, get information from them and so on
  with own [Commands]
  system control some amount of parameters. Parameters we receive with scheduled [Commands] 
  system can react according to added list of rules on Parameters changes. Reactions - again [Commands]
  that's why commands were design to be execute only but with ability to provide different results 


 - to check please start with 'SmartHome.ApiCommandCalls' project - it has static class with an examples for execution some [Command] with implementing calls to web api bridge 
 - Please pay attention on class BaseApiCommand - it implements 'generic call' to web api bridge. And All other commands in the implementation provides only types of request and response to web api bridge.
 - Please also pay attention to class 'ServiceConsumer' - I like it :) Initially I developed it for integration tests for web api services (u can make calls to web services providing needed types of request and respons), 
but then reused them in my smart home to implement [Command] with call to web api
 
BTW, this soft already partyally works now, so I can show how it works in real life.
